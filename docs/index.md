# Entrance page

To this page you should add links to your interactive html-maps that are located under your Exercise-5 repository like the following (*modify the username part* + *notice that **e**xercise starts with lower e -letter *):

Here is an example how to do it in MarkDown for user VuokkoH:

## Descriptions of the maps

### Static map
My static map visualizes a comparison between travel times by car and public transport to the following six shopping centers in Helsinki: Jumbo, Dixi, Myyrmanni, Itis, Forum, Iso Omena, and Ruoholahti. I calculated the difference between the travel time by public transport and car to each grid cell's closest shopping center. As can be seen on the map, there are a some areas (along Helsinki's main transportation routes) where travelling by public transport takes about as long or even less than travelling by car. However, in the north-west and far east of Helsinki travelling by car saves a lot of time.

### Interactive map
On my interactive map you can see the population density of Helsinki. Note that I excluded grid cells that had a population density of over 100% as these scewed the data set and made the visulalization less informative. As can be seen on the map the population density is below 50% almost everywhere in Helsinki. However, several areas along the coast and Kauniainen have a much higer population density. Moreover, the area north of the city center (around Kallio) seems to be a 'hole' in the population density, with sourrounding areas being more highly populated.
